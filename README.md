# sonic2practicerom
A Sonic 2 practice ROM meant for all emulators and console players. 
This ROM removes the score information normally displayed, and replaces it with 4 values: X Subpixels, Y Subpixels, X (Horizontal) Speed, and Spindash speed.

Below, are where the values are stored on the screen. They are currently displayed in hex. This will change, however it is still possible to use hex.
